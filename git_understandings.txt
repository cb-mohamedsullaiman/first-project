git is a version control system.
If anybody want to make changes to the current master branch, we can create our own branch and make changes in it

git add - used to add to staging
git status	- used to get status of the working tree
git diff	- used to get the difference between files and branches
git commit	- used to commit our changes
git init	- used to create an empty repository
git push	- used to push our changes to the remote branch
